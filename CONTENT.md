This is my tutorial on how to write content! Welcome! Having some text before the first header can be useful.

## First Heading

Start at heading level 2. You're free to use any heading style you want, such as:

Second Heading
--------------

Of course, subheadings are allowed also, and are in fact encouraged!

### Third Heading

If you want to write some Haskell code, you should mark it up like:

```haskell
main :: IO ()
main = putStrLn "Hello World!"
```

And don't forget that linking to content ([](somecontent.md)) and to
outlines ([insert-title](../outline/someoutline.md)) is a good idea.

You can use any kind of Markdown in an outline. But the recommendation is: give a short explanation in the intro of:

* What this contains
* Prior knowledge assumed
* Recommended tooling to have installed to follow along
* Possibly: how long it will take to complete

Then set up your outline as flat lists in individual sections

## Section 1

* [](../content/subject1.md)
* [](../content/subject2.md)
* [](../content/subject3.md)

## Section 2

* [](../content/subject4.md)
* [](../content/subject5.md)
* [](../content/subject6.md)
